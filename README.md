## Topics Learned
During the development of this project, I learned the following topics:

**HTML:**
- **Disabling virtual keyboard on mobile using inputmode attribute:** This calculator does not open a virtual keyboard on mobile as it already has its keyboard. So I implemented this by declaring an **"inputmode"** attribute with the value **"none"** inside the input tag in HTML. This attribute disables the on-screen keyboard on the mobile phone. 

**CSS:**
- **Using Grid:** I used the display grid property to layout the keys of this calculator. Grid makes it very easy to layout items in a row and column manner.

**JavaScript:**
- **Key event listener on non printing keys:** Some keys on the physical keyboard are non-printing keys (e.g. Alt key, Shift key, Backspace key) to listen to a key event on these keys we have to use a **"keydown"** listener. It can listen to any key on the physical keyboard.
